    "1. **Write Python code to calculate the OLR** given $\\epsilon$, $T_s$, and the temperature in each atmospheric layer. Your code should:\n",
    "    - be general enough to work for arbitrary $N$\n",
    "    - calculate the contributions to OLR from the surface and each $N$ atmospheric layer\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Check your code: set $T = T_s$ in every layer. **Verify that your code produces $OLR = \\sigma T_s^4$**.\n",
    "3. Use **observed global, annual mean temperatures** to tune your model:\n",
    "    - Use the NCEP reanalysis long-term-mean air temperature data, following the previous notes and homework. \n",
    "    - Use a sufficient number of layers in your model to get good resolution of the vertical structure. Try e.g. $N=30$.\n",
    "    - Use the data to set the temperatures in your model. You may need to do some interpolation between pressure levels.\n",
    "4. **Determine the value of your parameter $\\epsilon$ ** for which your code produces $OLR = 239$ W m$^{-2}$ given the observed temperatures.\n",
    "5. Using your tuned value of $\\epsilon$ and the observed temperatures, **calculate and plot the contributions from each layer (and the surface) to the OLR.**\n",
    "6. Now use your code to calculate the **radiative forcing** associated with a **1% increase in $\\epsilon$ **.\n",
    "7. Plot the **changes** in the contributions to OLR from each layer (and the surface).\n",
    "8. Discuss any interesting features of your answers.\n",
    "9. As usual, write up your answers (including text, code and figures) in a new IPython notebook that runs cleanly from start to finish. Save your notebook as `[your last name].ipynb`.\n",
    "10. Submit your answers by email before class on **Thursday March 2**."

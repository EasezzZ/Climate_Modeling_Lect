    "### Computational assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to make similar calculations using the RRTMG radiative transfer model in `climlab`. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a Radiative-Convective model with RRTMG radiation, a critical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km, and the Manabe relative humidity profile.\n",
    "- Tune the model so that, **at radiative-convective equilibrium**, it has both **realistic surface temperature** (near 288 K) and **realistic energy balance** (ASR and OLR both near 239 W/m2). To do this, you will probably need to adjust  surface albedo and introduce some clouds into the single-column model. See the lecture notes for examples. Make sure your methodology is explained clearly.\n",
    "- Now, using your tuned-up model, consider the effects of **small perturbations in absolute specific humidity**:\n",
    "    - Following Shine and Sinha, use a perturbation of 0.001 g/kg (but recall that `climlab` uses units of kg/kg for specific humidity).\n",
    "    - Add the small perturbation to the model specific humidity at one vertical level only.\n",
    "    - Calcuate the instantaneous radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere due to this increase.\n",
    "    - Calculate the equilibrium surface warming associated with this increase.\n",
    "    - Repeat these calculations for every vertical level.\n",
    "    - Make plots like Fig. 3 and Fig. 1 of the paper: radiative forcing and surface warming plotted as functions of the vertical level at which the water vapor is added.\n",
    "- Next, repeat these calculations but instead of using a fixed perturbation, **increase the specific humidity by 10% of its reference value at every level**. Again, plot the radiative forcing and surface warming as functions of the vertical level at which the water vapor is added.\n",
    "- Finally, **if you added some clouds to your tuned-up reference model**, take a look at **changes in the Cloud Radiative Effect** in some of your perturbations. Are they non-zero? Do you think it is meaningful to call these a *cloud feedback*? Why or why not?"
